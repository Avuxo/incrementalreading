On Thursday, a Ukrainian man who hatched a plan in 2013 to send heroin to my home and then call the cops when the drugs arrived was sentenced to 41 months in prison for unrelated cybercrime charges. Separately, a 19-year-old American who admitted to being part of a hacker group that sent a heavily-armed police force to my home in 2013 was sentenced to three years probation.</p><div><img src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/s-vovnenko.png\"><p class='anchor''>Sergei &#x201C;Fly&#x201D; Vovnenko, in an undated photo.

Prosecutors said Vovnenko operated a network of more than 13,000 hacked computers, using them to harvest credit card numbers and other sensitive information.</p><p class='anchor''>When I first became acquainted with Vovnenko in 2013, Fly was the administrator of the fraud forum &#x201C;thecc[dot]bz,&#x201D; an exclusive and closely guarded Russian language board dedicated to financial fraud and identity theft.</p><p class='anchor''>After I secretly gained access to his forum, I learned he&#x2019;d hatched a plot to have heroin sent to my home and to have one of his forum lackeys call the police when the drugs arrived.</p><p class='anchor''>I explained this whole ordeal <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/10/hacker-who-sent-me-heroin-faces-charges-in-u-s/\" target=\"_blank\">in great detail in 2015</a>, when Vovnenko initially was extradited from Italy to face charges here in the United States. In short, the antics didn&#x2019;t end when I foiled his plot to get me arrested for drug possession, and those antics likely contributed to his arrest and to this guilty plea.</p><p class='anchor''>Vovnenko contested his extradition from Italy, and in so doing spent roughly 15 months in arguably <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.it/20140615/italys-jailbirds-are-packed-like-sardines\" target=\"_blank\">Italy&#x2019;s worst prison</a>. During that time, he seemed to have turned his life around, sending me postcards at Christmas time and even an apparently heartfelt apology letter.</p><div><img src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/flypostcardback-580x503.png\"><p class='anchor''>Seasons greetings from my pen pal, Flycracker.</p></div><p class='anchor''>On Thursday, a judge in New Jersey sentenced Vovnenko to 41 months in prison, three years of supervised released and ordered him to pay restitution of $83,368.</p><p class='anchor''>Separately, a judge in Washington, D.C. handed down a sentence of three year&#x2019;s probation to <strong>Eric Taylor</strong>, a hacker probably better known by his handle &#x201C;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/CosmoTheGod\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmo the God</a>.&#x201D;</p><p class='anchor''>Taylor was among several men involved in making a false report to my local police department at the time about a supposed hostage situation at our Virginia home.

Because he served almost a year of detention prior to his sentencing, Islam was only expected to spend roughly a year in prison, although it appears he was released before even serving the entire year.</p><p class='anchor''>Hours after his sentencing, Taylor reached out to KrebsOnSecurity via Facetime to apologize for his actions.&#xA0;Taylor, a California native, said he is trying to turn his life around, and that he has even started his own <a href=\"https://cinder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">cybersecurity consultancy</a>.</p><p class='anchor''>&#x201C;I live in New York City now, have a baby on the way and am really trying to get my shit together finally,&#x201D; Taylor said.</p><p class='anchor''>If Taylor&#x2019;s physical&#xA0;appearance is any indication, he is indeed turning over a new leaf.

According to Taylor, his former co-conspirator Islam was recently re-arrested after allegedly cyberstalking Taylor&#x2019;s girlfriend.
